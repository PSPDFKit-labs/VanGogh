*Great things are done by a series of small things brought together. RxJava meets Animations.*

## Introduction

VanGogh is a lightweight library that takes Android view animation logic and binds it with RxJava2, providing a simple and powerful API for manipulating animations workflow. ([Also see the announcement blog post](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2017/reactive-animations-on-android-with-van-gogh/))

It also provides various pre-made commonly used animations such as fading, rotating, moving, etc. Another thing that you get are the base animation wrappers so you can create your own complex animations with custom actions.

For documentation on how to use the library, [please check the VanGogh wiki page](https://github.com/PSPDFKit-labs/VanGogh/wiki).

PSPDFKit offers [SDKs for iOS, Android, macOS, Windows and Web](https://pspdfkit.com/pdf-sdk/) to view, edit, annotate, fill forms and digitally sign PDF documents. VanGogh is used in [PDF Viewer for Android](https://pdfviewer.io/) as the main animation library.

## Example

Here's a really simple example of how you can chain animations together:

```kotlin
fadeIn(view1)
  .andThen(fadeIn(view2))
  .andThen(
    together(fadeOut(view3), fadeOut(view4)))
  .subscribe();
```
  
And this is just a tip of the iceberg! For further documentation see the [Wiki](https://github.com/PSPDFKit-labs/VanGogh/wiki).
